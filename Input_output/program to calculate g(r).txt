program to calculate g(r)

inputs: 

1. coord file, which has four columns separated by semicolons
    label ;  x ;  y ;  z ;

2. two integers A and B, to identify which partial rdf g_AB(r) we are finding 
    if B is put to 0 it will calculate the TOTAL rdf with respect to A

3. the cutoff for r 
    if put to 0 it will automatically calculate the maximum possible and use it

4. the precision = number of boxes for the histogram

output: file named g_{AB}_{cutoff}_{precision}.txt, with 2 columns
    r   value of g(r)
