### Simulation Project

This project is composed of the elaboration of an initial configuration for the simulation of a pure Lennard-Jones fluid with (if we have time), the simulation of a pure Lennard-Jones fluid hoping that the Monte-Carlo simulation of a finary fluid will be done.

Steps:

 - Starting set up
 - MC simulation
 - MC simulation of a binary mixture

Program developed by Alex Delhumeau and Timoth√©e Jamin.
