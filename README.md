### Simulation Project

This project is composed of the elaboration of an initial configuration for the simulation of a pure Lennard-Jones fluid with (if we have time), the simulation of a pure Lennard-Jones fluid hoping that the Monte-Carlo simulation of a binary fluid will be done. The program is able to compute n species inside a box.

Steps:

 - Starting set up
 - MC simulation
 - MC simulation of a binary and rank n mixture

Program developed by Alex Delhumeau and Timoth√©e Jamin. 

### How to launch?

First compile everything using the compiler.sh (just launch it on the terminal), then use the command:

./bin/PCCP_MC_LJ.x

## Known problems/inconveniences not corrected yet.

Be careful, the program isn't yet coded to launch everywhere and generate the starting folders and all.

If the number of steps is too high in one go, the program will be slower! You can solve this problem by restarting the program automatically that will average all the previous datas.

The g(r) computation isn't the fastest one, do not expect an excellent speed for such function.

### Note about the builds.

The tests where done using MINGW64 and gfortran. If any problems arise, please, try using the same environement.

    - MC simulation of binary (or N) mixture : 50%
        - Studying a mixture of two species to see the miscibility of two species.
            This is done by varying the ratios of Lennard-Jones parameters (epsilonA/epsilonB and sigmaA = sigmaB)                       -50%-
